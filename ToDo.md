Getting an API Key

An API Key is essentially a password that lets you use an API, this is used for identification purposes so the website can track how many requests you make using 
the API. For each API obtaining the key has varying amounts of difficulty depending on the platform itself. I want each pair to research getting the API key for the
scanner assigned and obtain one. If getting the key for the specific platform is too difficult contact me and I'll help you out.
