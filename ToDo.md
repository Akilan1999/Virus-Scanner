Getting an API Key

An API Key is essentially a password that lets you use an API, this is used for identification purposes so the website can track how many requests you make using 
the API. For each API obtaining the key has varying amounts of difficulty depending on the platform itself. I want each pair to research getting the API key for the
scanner assigned and obtain one. If getting the key for the specific platform is too difficult contact me and I'll help you out. 

For my specific API I had to make an account on the UrlScan.io website and create an API key, after that I installed the API via pip. Remember the process might be
different for you so make sure you google about.

If the scanner does not have an API key it might be following a request-json model, Make sure you read the documentation for each API well to understand how they work. 

IMP:

pip is an installer for python that helps you install various libraries. If you install anything at all via pip make sure you add the command to the setup.sh file. 

Follow the file structuring format and do not change files that you are not meant to be working on.

When commiting a file do not automatically merge it, make it a pull request and inform me, It will be merged after reviewing the code.
